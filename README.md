# Prerequisites

This project depends on [expres backend](https://github.com/emmanouil1989/expess-drizzleorm-postgresql). It need the server to run locally and that server requires a database container to run on docker. Also a registratio process hasn't been implemented yet. An API client has been used to call the register api and create a user to authenticate.

To run the project:

- Install libraries using your favorite package manager. `npm install`
- `ng serve` to start the project
